                        <h4>Experience in developing the website</h4>
                        <p>The topic was to create the personal information website which has all information regarding the student.
                        All the information regarding the student has put in the different pages. The website has pages like home, contact, CV, portfolio.
                        The pages are developed using HTML, CSS and Java Script. </p>
                        <p>The website has same header and footer for all the pages. The header section of the page has navigation bar who have pages name and linked the pages.
                        The header also has the web site name or logo. The footer section has information regarding the website developed company and year of last update.
                        The middle portion of the each page has the information as per the page topic. This section will be different in each page.</p>
                        <p>The web design of the website has decided as per the web site requirement. The main page of the site has image to welcome any user. The image has the user face and name.
                        It also has the purpose of the site. The font has decided as per the heading preference. The h1 tag has the largest font size where h5 has less font size. 
                        The span has different font style and color of the font is blue. Each detail topic is divided with the paragraph. 
                        The CV page information is divided using the column. The background of the pages are black or gray. The header and footer
                        has dark grey color where the middle portion has black background. It has balance as per the requirement. </p>
                        <h4>Reflection on the decision</h4>
                        <p>The decision made about the web page designing has taken by me only. I have taken the help from the online website who has received great response.
                        It helps in understanding the design process in detail. It has given the idea regarding the balance the web pages with color, font and size. 
                        I have faced issue while set the portfolio page. Where i have adjust the images. The image size was overlapping so it was difficult to adjust.
                        At last, i have fixed their sizes and it worked for me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The contact us page was easy to design. I have taken help from the other website contact us page and follow the pattern. The hover is applied on the sections or images.
                            The CV page is divided with the columns. The image and paragraph is adjusted in one column. It was difficult but i managed to set this two.
